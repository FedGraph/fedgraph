# Explanation and Best Practice for workers-head Reconnection

## Problem

For a `RayCluster` with a head and several workers, if a worker is crashed, it will be relaunched immediately and re-join the same cluster quickly; however, when the head is crashed, it will run into the issue [#104](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/issues/104) that all worker nodes are lost from the head for a long period of time.

## Explanation

> **note**
It was an issue that only happened with old version In the Kuberay version under 0.3.0, we recommand you try the latest version

When the head pod was deleted, it will be recreated with a new IP by KubeRay controllerï¼Œand the GCS server address is changed accordingly. The Raylets of all workers will try to get GCS address from Redis in `ReconnectGcsServer`, but the redis_clients always use the previous head IP, so they will always fail to get new GCS address. The Raylets will not exit until max retries are reached. There are two configurations determining this long delay:

```
/// The interval at which the gcs rpc client will check if gcs rpc server is ready.
RAY_CONFIG(int64_t, ping_gcs_rpc_server_interval_milliseconds, 1000)

/// Maximum number of times to retry ping gcs rpc server when gcs server restarts.
RAY_CONFIG(int32_t, ping_gcs_rpc_server_max_retries, 600)

https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/98be9fb5e08befbd6cac3ffbcaa477c5117b0eef/src/ray/gcs/gcs_client/gcs_client.cc#L294-L295
```

It retries 600 times and each interval is 1s, resulting in total 600s timeout, i.e. 10 min. So immediately after 10-min wait for retries, each client exits and gets restarted while connecting to the new head IP. This issue exists in stable ray versions under 1.9.1. This has been reduced to 60s in recent commit under Kuberay 0.3.0.

## Solution
We recommend using the latest version of KubeRay. After version 0.5.0, the GCS Fault-Tolerance feature is now in beta and can help resolve this reconnection issue.

## Best Practice

For older version (Kuberay <=0.4.0, ray <=2.1.0). To reduce the chances of a lost worker-head connection, there are two other options:

- Make head more stable: when creating the cluster, allocate sufficient amount of resources on head pod such that it tends to be stable and not easy to crash. You can also set {"num-cpus": "0"} in "rayStartParams" of "headGroupSpec" such that Ray scheduler will skip the head node when scheduling workloads. This also helps to maintain the stability of the head.

- Make reconnection shorter: for version <= 1.9.1, you can set this head param --system-config='{"ping_gcs_rpc_server_max_retries": 20}' to reduce the delay from 600s down to 20s before workers reconnect to the new head.
