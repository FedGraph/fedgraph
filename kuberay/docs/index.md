## KubeRay

KubeRay is a powerful, open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) applications on Kubernetes. It offers several key components:

**KubeRay core**: This is the official, fully-maintained component of KubeRay that provides three custom resource definitions, RayCluster, RayJob, and RayService. These resources are designed to help you run a wide range of workloads with ease.

* **RayCluster**: KubeRay fully manages the lifecycle of RayCluster, including cluster creation/deletion, autoscaling, and ensuring fault tolerance.

* **RayJob**: With RayJob, KubeRay automatically creates a RayCluster and submits a job when the cluster is ready. You can also configure RayJob to automatically delete the RayCluster once the job finishes.

* **RayService**: RayService is made up of two parts: a RayCluster and a Ray Serve deployment graph. RayService offers zero-downtime upgrades for RayCluster and high availability.

**Community-managed components (optional)**: Some components are maintained by the KubeRay community.

* **KubeRay APIServer**: It provides a layer of simplified configuration for KubeRay resources. The KubeRay API server is used internally
by some organizations to back user interfaces for KubeRay resource management.

* **KubeRay Python client**: This Python client library provides APIs to handle RayCluster from your Python application.

* **KubeRay CLI**: KubeRay CLI provides the ability to manage KubeRay resources through command-line interface.

## Security

**Security and isolation must be enforced outside of the Ray Cluster.** Restrict network access with Kubernetes or other external controls. Refer to [**Ray security documentation**](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-security/index.html) for more guidance on what controls to implement.

Please report security issues to security@anyscale.com.

## The Ray docs

You can find even more information on deployments of Ray on Kubernetes at the [official Ray docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html).
