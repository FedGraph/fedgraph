# Securing API server

Currently the KubeRay API server deployed on a publicly accessible cluster is directly exposed to the internet with no authentication/authorization. To protect its endpoint we need to introduce security.
The solution is based on the architecture below:

![Overall security implementation](img/authorization.png)

It basically adds Authorization sidecar to the KubeRay API server pod. This architecture is extremely flexible and allows users to plug sidecar implementations that adhere to their security requirements, that can differ significantly across multiple organizations.

Here we will use a very simple [sidecar implementation](../experimental/cmd/main.go) a reverse proxy using token based authorization. This is a very simple authorization based on the string token, shared between proxy and client. This implementation is not meant for production, but rather is here as a demonstration for the overall implementation. Additional examples of reverse proxy implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/blublinsky/auth-reverse-proxy). There is also a wealth of open source implementations, for example, [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) and many commercial offerings.

## Basic token-based authentication reverse proxy

A simple token-based authentication reverse proxy [implementation](../experimental/cmd/main.go) is provided in the project along with make targets to build a docker image for it and push this image to the image repository. There is also a pre-build image `kuberay/security-proxy:nightly` that you can use for experimenting with security.

## Installation

Setting up kind cluster with all required things can be done using the following command:

```shell
make operator-image docker-image security-proxy-image cluster load-operator-image load-image load-security-proxy-image deploy-operator deploy
```

Note. To use this command, please modify [values.yaml](../helm-chart/kuberay-apiserver/values.yaml) to set the parameter `security.proxy.tag` to `latest`.

The API server helm chart is updated to support both insecure and secure installations. To achieve this [valumes.yaml file](../helm-chart/kuberay-apiserver/values.yaml) is extended to include security configuration:

```yaml
security:
  proxy:
    repository: kuberay/security-proxy
    tag: nightly
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  env:
    HTTP_LOCAL_PORT: 8988
    GRPC_LOCAL_PORT: 8987
    SECURITY_TOKEN: "12345"
    SECURITY_PREFIX: "/"
    ENABLE_GRPC: "true"
```

removing security configuration there will run API server without security

with security configuration in place you can install API server using the following helm command (assuming that you are in the `helm-chart` directory of the project):

```shell
helm install apiserver kuberay-apiserver
```

## Testing

Once the API server is installed, the command below

```shell
curl --silent -X POST 'localhost:31888/apis/v1/namespaces/default/compute_templates' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name": "default-template",
  "namespace": "default",
  "cpu": 2,
  "memory": 4
}'
```

fails with result `Unauthorised`
To make it work we need to add an authorization header to the request:

```shell
curl --silent -X POST 'localhost:31888/apis/v1/namespaces/default/compute_templates' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: 12345' \
--data '{
  "name": "default-template",
  "namespace": "default",
  "cpu": 2,
  "memory": 4
}'
```
