## 📊 Theoretical Predictions

### Cora Dataset with FedGCN

| Method | Test Accuracy | Δ vs Plaintext | Confidence |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Plaintext** | ~0.82 | - | Baseline |
| **OpenFHE** | ~0.81 | < 1% | 90% |

### Why We're Confident

```
Current OpenFHE Parameters:
├─ Scale: 2^50
│  └─> Provides ~15 decimal digits precision
│  └─> Relative error: < 2^-49 ≈ 10^-15
│
├─ Ring dimension: 16384
│  └─> 128-bit security
│  └─> Can pack up to 8192 values per ciphertext
│
├─ Multiplicative depth: 2
│  └─> Sufficient for additions (no multiplications in pretrain)
│
└─ Operations: Additions only
   └─> Minimal noise accumulation
   └─> Expected final noise: < 10^-6
```

## 🔬 CKKS Precision Analysis

### For Feature Values in Range [-1, 1]

```python
Scale = 2^50
Precision bits = 50

Absolute error per value:
  = 2^(-50) 
  = ~10^-15
  ≈ 0.000000000000001

For aggregating N=2 trainers:
  Final error = sqrt(N) × 10^-15
             = ~1.4 × 10^-15
             ≈ 0.0000000000000014
```

**Conclusion**: Encryption noise is **negligible** compared to model accuracy (~0.8).

## 🧮 Step-by-Step Error Analysis

### Pretrain Phase (Where OpenFHE is Used)

```
1. Feature Values
   Range: [-1, 1] (after normalization)
   Precision: float32 (7 decimal digits)

2. Encryption Error
   CKKS with scale 2^50
   Error per value: ~10^-15
   >> Much smaller than float32 precision

3. Homomorphic Addition (N=2 trainers)
   Error growth: sqrt(N) × base_error
   = 1.4 × 10^-15
   >> Still negligible

4. Threshold Decryption
   Two partial decryptions + fusion
   Additional error: ~10^-15
   Total error: ~2 × 10^-15
   >> Still negligible

5. Impact on Model Accuracy
   Model accuracy: ~0.82
   Encryption error: ~10^-15
   Relative impact: 10^-15 / 0.82 ≈ 10^-15
   Percentage: < 0.000000000001%
```

**Theoretical prediction**: **< 0.0001%** accuracy loss  
**Conservative estimate**: **< 1%** (accounting for implementation variations)

## 📐 Why < 1% is Conservative

### Sources of Error (All Accounted For)

1. ✅ **CKKS Rounding**: < 10^-15 (negligible)
2. ✅ **Noise Growth**: < 10^-14 (negligible)
3. ✅ **Threshold Fusion**: < 10^-15 (negligible)
4. ⚠️ **Implementation Variations**: Could add ~0.1-0.5%
5. ⚠️ **Numerical Stability**: Could add ~0.1-0.5%

**Total Expected**: 0.2-1.0% (being very conservative)
