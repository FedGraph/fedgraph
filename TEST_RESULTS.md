## ⏳ Runtime Tests (Requires Docker)

These tests need Docker with OpenFHE installed:

### Test 6: OpenFHE Installation ⏳
```bash
docker run --rm fedgraph-openfhe python -c "import openfhe; print(openfhe.__version__)"
```
**Status**: Pending (Docker daemon not running)

### Test 7: Basic Threshold Protocol ⏳
```bash
docker run --rm fedgraph-openfhe python -c "
from fedgraph.openfhe_threshold import test_threshold_he
test_threshold_he()
"
```
**Status**: Pending (Docker daemon not running)

### Test 8: Full NC Tutorial ⏳
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app/workspace -w /app/workspace \
    fedgraph-openfhe python tutorials/FGL_NC_HE.py
```
**Status**: Pending (Docker daemon not running)
